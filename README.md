<p>The Music Player App is a lightweight music player that lets users play songs stored on their device. It uses the phoneâ€™s internal database to load and manage music files, including metadata like song titles and album artwork. Users can create playlists, search by artist or title, and control playback with features like shuffle and repeat. With a modern, user-friendly interface, the app provides an offline music experience without requiring internet access.</p>
